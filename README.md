# Insurance Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on analyzing insurance data. The analysis involves exploring the dataset, visualizing key trends, and building predictive models to derive insights about insurance-related factors.

## Overview

The `insurance-analysis.ipynb` notebook includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- **Modeling**: Building and evaluating predictive models to analyze insurance data.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of trends and model performance.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd insurance-analysis
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook insurance-analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information related to insurance, including variables such as age, gender, BMI, region, charges, and more. Ensure the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook and is named `insurance.csv` unless otherwise specified in the notebook.

## Results

- Key insights from the data are highlighted in the notebook.
- Predictive models provide an understanding of the factors influencing insurance charges.
- Visualizations offer an intuitive view of the trends and patterns in the data.
